# awesome_Recursive_Self-Improving_LLM
Recursive Self-Improvement refers to the process by which an AI system, particularly LLMs, improves its own architecture, knowledge, or reasoning abilities without human intervention. This repository serves as a hub for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in advancing the frontier of self-evolving AI systems.
